# About Me

## Info About Me

Hello, I am a small developer (literally I am 5'5").  
I am from Tennessee. When I am bored, I either game, code, or talk with friends online.  
The OS I personally love to use is Linux.  
My current setup is [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) (an Arch-based distro) using [KDE](https://kde.org/).  
The code editor I use for general stuff is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
When I am coding in C#, since [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) does not have Linux support,  
I use a JetBrains IDE called [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

## Coding Languages I Know

Python (5 years)  
C# (2 years)  
JavaScript (2 years)
